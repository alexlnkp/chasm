A single-header library for use in situations where WHOLE stdio.h is simply unnecessary.
Currently only works on linux due to heavy reliance on syscalls.

TODO:
- Make fstring() be able to print out float numbers
- Make printf() function that also doesn't rely on vsnprintf() (or make an alternative to vsnprintf())
- Attempt to get rid of `stdarg.h` dependency (might not be possible due to it possibly being a compiler hack)

Currently working:
- Printing to STDOUT
- String length calculation using a custom str_len() function
- String formatting using a custom `fprintf()` function, "fstring()"
